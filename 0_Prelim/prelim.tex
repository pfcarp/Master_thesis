% Degree year is the year the diploma is expected, and defense year is
% the year the dissertation is written up and defended. Often, these
% will be the same, except for January graduation, when your defense
% will be in the fall of year X, and your graduation will be in
% January of year X+1

% For each reader, specify appropriate label {First, Second, Third},
% then name, and title. IMPORTANT: The title should be:
%   "Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering",
% or similar, but it MUST NOT be:
%   Professor, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering"
% or you will be asked to reprint and get new signatures.
% Warning: If you have more than five readers you are out of luck,
% because it will overflow to a new page. You may try to put part of
% the title in with the name.

% The Major Professor is the same as the first reader, but must be

%                       PRELIMINARY PAGES
% According to the BU guide the preliminary pages consist of:
% title, copyright (optional), approval,  acknowledgments (opt.),
% abstract, preface (opt.), Table of contents, List of tables (if
% any), List of illustrations (if any). The \tableofcontents,
% \listoffigures, and \listoftables commands can be used in the
% appropriate places. For other things like preface, do it manually
% with something like \newpage\section*{Preface}.

% This is an additional page to print a boxed-in title, author name and
% degree statement so that they are visible through the opening in BU
% covers used for reports. This makes a nicely bound copy. Uncomment only
% if you are printing a hardcopy for such covers. Leave commented out
% when producing PDF for library submission.
%\buecethesistitleboxpage

% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.
\maketitle
\cleardoublepage

% The copyright page is blank except for the notice at the bottom. You
% must provide your name in capitals.

% Now include the approval page based on the readers information
% Once the approval page is approved by the Mugar Library staff, please
% comment out the "\approvalpagewithcomment" line and uncomment "\approvalpage"
%\approvalpagewithcomment
\approvalpage
\cleardoublepage

% Here goes your favorite quote. This page is optional.
\newpage
%\thispagestyle{empty}
\input{0_Prelim/quote}
\cleardoublepage

% The acknowledgment page should go here. Use something like
% \newpage\section*{Acknowledgments} followed by your text.
\newpage
\section*{\centerline{Acknowledgments}}
\input{0_Prelim/ack}
\cleardoublepage

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

\begin{abstractpage}
\input{0_Prelim/abs}
\end{abstractpage}
\cleardoublepage

% Now you can include a preface. Again, use something like
% \newpage\section*{Preface} followed by your text

% Table of contents comes after preface
\tableofcontents
\cleardoublepage

% If you do not have tables, comment out the following lines
\newpage
\listoftables
\cleardoublepage

% If you have figures, uncomment the following line
\newpage
\listoffigures
\cleardoublepage

% List of Abbrevs is NOT optional (Martha Wellman likes all abbrevs listed)
\chapter*{List of Abbreviations}

%{\color{red} As per BU library instructions, the list of abbreviations must be in alphabetical order by the {\bf abbreviation}, not by the explanation, or it will be returned to you for re-ordering. {\bf This comment must be removed in the final document.}}
