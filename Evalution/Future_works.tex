There are several improvements to be made on the AoE implementation. The immediate efforts lie in implementing submodules to handle the remaining AXI channels. Similar efforts wil also create sumbmodules to handle the ACE protocol extension of AXI. We are also interested in the space of extending hardware mechanisms with remote capabilities. Primarily, efforts to extend ACE with remote capabilities to lower the implementation difficulties and overhead related to distributed memory. In addition, we would like to extend the Coresight debug infrastructure in the same manner to potentially adapt methods such as \cite{chenTPA} and verify feasibility of orchestrating hardware on remote systems.
